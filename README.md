# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to show the data of fares, their averages, and the amount of drivers
working for Pyber by city type. Data is broken down into city, suburban, and rural types, and 
data is analyzed to show these results.

# Results

The line graph shows that there were many more riders in urban environments than rural, which is 
assumed data already, but that the average fare per ride was much higher in the rural areas, and suburban areas, than 
the urban ones.
The rural drivers, however, earned higher fares, due to the amount of total drivers in this city type being much lower.

# Summary
There are a few things that could help with the business to develop based on the data.
Drivers could be informed that they could earn more by moving their work out of the urban areas and working more in the
suburban, ore espescially the rural areas.
Suburban drivers earned over double what the urban drivers did, and gave several less rides per driver there than the urban drivers.
Rural areas might be able to earn more users/fares by lowering the price paid per ride. The amount of rides given is drastically lower than
in even the suburban, and espescially the urban areas.
